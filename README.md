- Classic Games in computer form 

### ROCK PAPER SCISSORS 
- This classic game with some flare. This game was really fun to build and I was able to practice using switch statements which I have not used a lot of in the past. The CSS and color palettes where fun to choose as well. I used a blue color scheme I think it looks cool. For a basic game I had fun coming up with new ways to implement this idea. 

### MEMORY GAME
