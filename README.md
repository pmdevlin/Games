- Classic Games in computer form 

### ROCK PAPER SCISSORS 
- This classic game with some flare. This game was really fun to build and I was able to practice using switch statements which I have not used a lot of in the past. The CSS and color palettes where fun to choose as well. I used a blue color scheme I think it looks cool. For a basic game I had fun coming up with new ways to implement this idea. 

### MEMORY GAME 
- The classic game of memory that we all played as a kids. this is one of my favorite games to play with my kids. Not only because I am unbeatable but because its iconic. I just have the basic vision completed from the tutorial I am working with but I am going to revamp the code using more array helper methods and trying to simplify more if I can. as of right now the code is fully functional. ENJOY!!!!
